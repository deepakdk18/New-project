 In this I have deployed a serverless web application on AWS, leveraging the power of various AWS services. I have walk through each step, from setting up an S3 bucket to hosting our static web content, configuring API Gateway to trigger Lambda functions for handling GET and POST requests to interact with a DynamoDB database, and finally, securing your application using CloudFront.

1. Setting up an S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket to host our static web content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. Configuring API Gateway: Learn how to configure API Gateway endpoints to trigger Lambda functions. We'll cover both GET and POST methods to interact with our DynamoDB database.

3. Creating Lambda Functions: Write Lambda functions in Python to handle the API Gateway requests. For example, we'll create functions to retrieve data from DynamoDB and insert new data into it.

4. Working with DynamoDB: Set up a DynamoDB table to store our data. We'll learn how to define the table schema and perform CRUD operations using Lambda functions.

5. Implementing Secure Connections with CloudFront: To ensure secure access to our web application, we'll deploy CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN). We'll configure CloudFront to serve our S3 content securely over HTTPS, providing encryption in transit and improving the performance of our application.

I look forward to applying these skills to future projects and exploring more AWS capabilities.
